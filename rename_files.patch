-README for Sphinx
-=================
+HgBlog is a set of modifications to the Sphinx project to make it slightly more 
+suitable as a blogging engine.  It's built for those of us who love using
+reStructuredText markup to write documents.
 
-Installing
-==========
+The quickstart wizard handles setting up an HgBlog for you.  This includes all
+of the usual things that the Sphinx quickstart utility does, but it creates a
+Mercurial repository and installs a hook and intelligent ignores for you.  The
+hook will automatically convert the ``.rst`` files that Mercurial is tracking
+into HTML using Sphinx when you commit changes to the repository.
 
-Use ``setup.py``::
+Additionally, when you pull changes in from a remote clone of the repository, 
+the hook will do the conversion just like when you commit locally.  You can set
+the hook up on remote clones as well.  The hook *only* converts ``.rst`` files
+that are tracked by Mercurial.  This means you can work on new blog articles 
+without committing them to the repository to have them not appear online.
 
-   python setup.py build
-   sudo python setup.py install
+--------
 
+Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful
+documentation for Python projects (or other documents consisting of multiple
+reStructuredText sources), written by Georg Brandl.  It was originally created
+for the new Python documentation, and has excellent facilities for Python
+project documentation, but C/C++ is supported as well, and more languages are
+planned.
 
-Reading the docs
-================
+Sphinx uses reStructuredText as its markup language, and many of its strengths
+come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText and its parsing
+and translating suite, the Docutils.
 
-After installing::
+Among its features are the following:
 
-   cd doc
-   sphinx-build . _build/html
+* Output formats: HTML (including derivative formats such as HTML Help, Epub
+  and Qt Help), plain text, manual pages and LaTeX or direct PDF output
+  using rst2pdf
+* Extensive cross-references: semantic markup and automatic links
+  for functions, classes, glossary terms and similar pieces of information
+* Hierarchical structure: easy definition of a document tree, with automatic
+  links to siblings, parents and children
+* Automatic indices: general index as well as a module index
+* Code handling: automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter
+* Flexible HTML output using the Jinja 2 templating engine
+* Various extensions are available, e.g. for automatic testing of snippets
+  and inclusion of appropriately formatted docstrings
+* Setuptools integration
 
-Then, direct your browser to ``_build/html/index.html``.
-
-Or read them online at <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>.
