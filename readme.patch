-README for Sphinx
-=================
+HgBlog is a set of modifications to the Sphinx project to make it slightly more 
+suitable as a blogging engine.  It's built for those of us who love using
+reStructuredText markup to write documents.
 
-Installing
-==========
+The quickstart wizard handles setting up an HgBlog for you.  This includes all
+of the usual things that the Sphinx quickstart utility does, but it creates a
+Mercurial repository and installs a hook and intelligent ignores for you.  The
+hook will automatically convert the ``.rst`` files that Mercurial is tracking
+into HTML using Sphinx when you commit changes to the repository.
 
-Use ``setup.py``::
+Additionally, when you pull changes in from a remote clone of the repository, 
+the hook will do the conversion just like when you commit locally.  You can set
+the hook up on remote clones as well.  The hook *only* converts ``.rst`` files
+that are tracked by Mercurial.  This means you can work on new blog articles 
+without committing them to the repository to have them not appear online.
